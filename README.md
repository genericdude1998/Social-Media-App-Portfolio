# My Simple Social Media App
**Welcome to my Porfolio Social Media App!**

The App allows you to browse through a list of posts with the ability to comment on them or create your own post!

## Description

For this project I wanted to showcase not only knowledge of React but also proficiency with testing environments such as Enzyme, Cypress as well as Redux, ESLint, CSS modules, Webpack and Babel.

Everything is made from scatch without the use of Create-React-App.
